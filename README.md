Hello World!  Welcome, all of you, to my GitHub account. 

I am currently a student pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. 
I initially wanted to be a doctor and went to medical school for a year.

However, during the pandemic, I fell in love with technology. 
I mean, I always had a thing for technology. 
Still, I ignored that desire until the pandemic where I was stuck at home with a computer, 
a keyboard, and a clock where the time just did not tick away. 

After watching hundreds of Youtube and TikTok videos, I realized that my heart desired technology more than medicine. 
After making that decision, I decided to pursue computer science to learn the fundamentals and theory of computers. 

Also, I spent my own time learning new languages such as Java and Python and 
implementing my knowledge in my very technical projects.

Hope you guys like my work, and please feel free to leave any feedback that may help me improve my skill set.
